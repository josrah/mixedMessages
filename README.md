## Introduction
Project using JavaScript in the Codecademy Full-Stack Engineer Career Path. This version answers the user where an object is with a preposition, room, and furniture.

## Overview from Codecademy
For this project, you will build a message generator program. Every time a user 
runs a program, they should get a new, randomized output. Youâ€™re welcome to take 
the project in a couple of different forms, like an astrology generator, inspirational 
message, or nonsensical jokes. To make your program truly random, the message 
that it outputs should be made up of at least three different pieces of data. 
Take what you know of JavaScript syntax so far to build the program and customize 
it to your liking.
